# LaaganSignupLogin
The Sign up and Log In form for the webdev project 'Laagan'

To start the website:

1. open terminal in code editor
2. type cd .\login-signup\
3. type npm start

All files edited are in the component folder, with assets holding the images and LoginSignup holding .jsx and .css files.

The code implements a LoginSignup component through React, which allows for the toggling between a Login and a Sign Up form. It utilizes the useState hook to manage the state of the action variable, determining which one the user is viewing (Login or Sign up)
